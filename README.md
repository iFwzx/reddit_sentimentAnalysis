This study presents a sentiment analysis model using MultinomialNB and CountVectorizer algorithms to classify depression posts on Reddit as positive or negative. The model achieved an accuracy score of 0.89 on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in predicting sentiment in depression-related posts. The dataset used for training and testing the model consisted of 7000+ Reddit posts related to depression. The results suggest that the proposed model can accurately identify the sentiment in depression-related posts and could be applied to other mental health-related text classification tasks. The findings of this study could have significant implications for mental health professionals and researchers, as well as individuals seeking support on social media platforms.
